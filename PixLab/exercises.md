# Picture Lab - Exercises

Here is a checklist of code additions/modification that will be made in the
various Picture Lab (A1-A9) exercises. Place an “X” in column “A” when you have
completed the associated exercise, indicated in columns “B” and “C”.

Example: Lab “A4” exercise “2” requires changing “getLargest” method in “IntArrayWorker.java”.
Copy your modified “IntArrayWorker.java” file into your student folder and
update this document, putting “X” in column “A” of that row.

In other words, when you have completed everything, not only will there be a
bunch of “X”s in column A, but there will be three java files and a jpg file in
your student folder. I will use THIS DOCUMENT to determine what “exercises” have
been completed. The “questions” will be completed on seperate documents found in
your student folder.
