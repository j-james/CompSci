A <adjective> Poem

By <first-and-last-name>

’Twas <adjective> , and the slithy <noun>
      Did gyre and gimble in the <noun> :
All mimsy were the <plural-noun> ,
      And the mome <noun> outgrabe.

“Beware the <noun> , my son!
      The <plural-body-part> that bite, the <plural-body-part> that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
      The frumious <noun> !”

He took his <adjective> <noun> in hand;
      Long time the <adjective> foe he sought—
So rested he by the Tumtum <plant>
      And stood awhile in thought.

And, as in <adjective> thought he stood,
      The <noun> , with eyes of <noun> ,
Came <gerund> through the tulgey <noun> ,
      And burbled as it came!

<number> , <number> ! <number> , <number> ! And through and through
      The <adjective> blade went <onomatopoeia> !
He left it dead, and with its <body-part>
      He went <gerund> back.

“And hast thou <verbed> the <noun> ?
      Come to my <body-part>, my <adjective> boy!
O <nonsense-word> day! Callooh! Callay!”
      He <verbed> in his <noun> .

’Twas <adjective> , and the slithy <noun>
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the <plural-nouns> ,
      And the mome <noun> outgrabe.
