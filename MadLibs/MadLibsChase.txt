A shiny Poem

By Chase Van Derrick

’Twas keyboard , and the slithy Nintendo Switch
Did gyre and gimble in the Golf Story :
All mimsy were the games ,
And the mome Zelda outgrabe.

“Beware the Link , my son!
The ear fungii that bite, the eyebrows that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Derrik !”

He took his nice Splatoon in hand;
Long time the cool foe he sought—
So rested he by the Tumtum plant
And stood awhile in thought.

And, as in <adjective> thought he stood,
The DELL , with eyes of computer ,
Came running through the tulgey Linux ,
And burbled as it came!

42 , 42 ! 42 , 42 ! And through and through
The sleek blade went bow-chicka bow !
He left it dead, and with its hoodie
He went kindling back.

“And hast thou runned the XPS 13 ?
Come to my potato, my dull boy!
O cbsds day! Callooh! Callay!”
He verbed in his light .

’Twas cool-beans , and the slithy desktop
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the shoes ,
And the mome safeway outgrabe.
